After some discussion with elenacliu, I decided to start with some topics.
- Array
- DP
- String
- Math
- Tree
- DFS/BFS
- HashTable
- Greedy
- Sort

Each topic may take 2-5days to finish, including revising necessary data structure knowledge. It could be a little bit difficult for me. But as a road that must be taken, I gotta overcome it.
